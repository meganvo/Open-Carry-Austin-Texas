        		<p>During my internship at Bartle Bogle Hegarty New York (BBH), we were presented with the brief to "Do Good, Famously". This three word challenge was daunting. No defined constraints brought <span class="emphasis">too much</span> creative freedom. We spent a good chunk of our 10-weeks brainstorming hundreds of ideas.</p>

        		<p>I quickly learned the importance of the discovery stage in design - <span class="strong">validate ideas before dedicating resources to execution</span>.</p>

   			<p>Our team chose to raise awareness and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable disease. One of the symptoms of ALS is speech loss. We focused our idea around a universal truth - when you can't speak, words mean a lot. 

   			<p>We asked four people living with ALS what they wanted to say to a loved one.<p>

   			<div class="quote">"...to my three sons: We began our journey together over twenty years ago. Along the way, we skipped and tripped. Some steps were tentative, others bold and forward...carry these close to your hearts."</div>

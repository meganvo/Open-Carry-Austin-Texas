        		<h3 class="strong">Validate the idea, then the execution</h3>
        		<p>During my internship at Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), we were challenged with a three word creative brief -"Do Good, Famously". We spent a good chunk of our 10-weeks brainstorming hundreds of ideas.</p>

        		<p>I quickly learned the importance of the discovery stage in design - validate the idea before rushing into the execution.</p>

   			<h3 class="strong">When you can't speak, words mean eveyrthing</h3>
   			<p>Our team chose to raise awareness and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), an incurable disease. One of the symptoms of ALS is speech loss. We focused our idea around a universal truth:

   			<span class="emphasis">when you can't speak, words mean everything.</span>

   			<p>We worked with the ALS Association of New York who connected us to four people living with ALS. We asked what they wanted to say to a loved one. Here's what Kevin wanted to say to his friends:<p>

   			<div class="quote">"Despite being surrounded by 9 million in neighbors, New York City can be lonely at times. It is a city with an actual pulse,  produced and felt by the diverse, creative, and determined people who call it home. Every Sunday you made that city feel like home to me.   
  			Our backgrounds, hair colors, and even our personal styles could not be more different but thankfully our hearts, palates, and friendship were what mattered most. You are all parts of me, so I thank you for being you."</div>

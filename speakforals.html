        		<h3 class="strong">Focus on the Idea, Not the Execution</h3>
        		<p>During my internship at Bartle Bogle Hegarty New York (BBH), we were presented with the brief to "Do Good, Famously". This three word challenge was a daunting open-ended opportunity. No defined constraints brought <span class="emphasis">too much</span> creative freedom. We spent a good chunk of our 10-weeks brainstorming hundreds of ideas.</p>

        		<p>This taught me something that's fundamental to the design process - regardless of the industry: <span class="strong">validate ideas before dedicating resources to execution</span>.</p>

   			<h3 class="strong">When You Can't Speak, Words Mean Everything</h3>
   			<p>Our team chose to raise awareness and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It's still an incurable disease. One of the symptoms of ALS is speech loss and we focused our idea around a universal truth - when you can't speak, words mean a lot. 

   			<p>We asked four people living with ALS what they wanted to say to a loved one.<p>

   			<div class="highlight sub-headline">"...the only thing I regret is not being able to sing to Jocelyn like I did before. Whenever we listen to Twinkle Twinkle, I cry and so does she."</div>

   			<div class="highlight sub-headline">"...to my three sons: We began our journey together over twenty years ago. Along the way, we skipped and tripped. Some steps were tentative, others bold and forward. We slid in chocolate-colored mud. We also learned certain truths: carry these close to your hearts."</div>

   			<p>We also shot a video to promote our campaign.</p>

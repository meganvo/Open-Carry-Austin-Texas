			<h1>RigUp</h1>
			<h2>Making it easy to bid out complex oilfield jobs</h2>
			<p>For two years I lead design at RigUp where we made bidding easier for the oilfield.</p>

			<p class="caption center">Entire Bidding Process</p>
			<section><p>RigUp is an oilfield services marketplace that connects engineers & vendors for an easier bidding process. I joined RigUp as the first designer and eventually led a small design team throughout the entire product development process.</p>

			<p>We were a small (but rapidly growing) company, which meant I had to wear a lot hats. I tackled everything from front-end implementation, conducting usability tests, and driving marketing and branding design.</p>

			<h2>Increasing bid creation conversion rates</h2>

			<h3>Background</h3>
				<img src="img/bidding/old_process.png">	
				<p class="caption center">Bid Creation Process</p>
			
			<section><p>The bid creation process was in need of a redesign. The UX was a result of technical and product debt; we were implementing MVP after MVP into the process without any design consideration. It was time to clean up and scale!
</p></section>
<section>
		
			<h3>Problem</h3>
			
			<h2 class="center problem">The bid creation process <span class="strong">only had a 46.15% conversion rate.</span></h2> By identifying the highest dropoffs points, I was able to guide my research in where to investigate.</p>

			<h3>Research Insights</h3>
			<p>Through usability testing sessions, talking with users and data analytics, I discovered a couple of insights about the bidding process.</p>
	
			<p class="strong">Heavy initial cognitive load</p>
							<img src="img/bidding/step1_old.png">	
														<p class="caption center">Step One</p>


			<p>Step one was initially overwhelming - users were being confronted with many inputs.</p>
			<p class="strong">Unintuitive information grouping</p>
			<p>Users were going back and forth between steps to reference information.</p>

	<p class="caption center">Card Sorting Test</p>
	<p>Through card sorting tests, I was able to better understand how users categorize the information.</p>
		
<section>
	<h3>Ideation</h3>
	<p>Due to a technical constraint, I couldn't change the functionality of the vendor selection - meaning it had to remain a separate step. To overcome this tradeoff, I designed user flows that allowed the user to forego this step altogether.

<section>
	<h3>Solution</h3>
	<p>The new bidding process was reduced to three simple steps.</p>

	<p>To begin the request the user is prompted with the basics, instead of overwhelimng the user off the bat with choices.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The conversion rate increased to 85.66%. Two months after implementation, bid requests increased as well and we were on the right track to meeting our quarterly GMV goal. Additional unanticipated success included increased user retention and less usability questions asked to our customer support team about the bidding process.</p>
</div>

<!--<section>
	<div id="container">
	<p>Defining the request is where the majority of users dropped off in the bidding process. In the initial design, this was broken into three separate steps. I knew we needed to simplify the process - but how?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="full-width"><img src="img/bidding/step_one_b.png"></div>
	<p class="caption">Define the Request</p>

<section>
	<div id="container">
	<p>Before RigUp, bids are submitted as a PDF or Excel spreadsheet. I compared bids across venders and identified a pattern in how they were compiled. This insight informed my design for a UI that touched on a familiar frame of reference for users. The workscope and request details were the header of the submission, with line items and pricing information below that - structurally similar to an invoice.</p>

	<h3>Specify vendors</h3>
	<p>Once the request is defined, buyers can select who they want to request a quote from. Finding vendors to bid out to is difficult since a lot of them are mom and pop shops without a website. As a result, many companies stick to using vendors that they already know - even if they aren't the safest or best for the job. I designed a marketplace that makes it easy for buyers to find vendors by their services, location, and safety ratings.<p>

	<!--<div id="container">
	<h3>Submitting bids</h3>
	<p>We also made submitting bids easier and secure for vendors. Designing a mobile-first experience for vendors was crucial since most of the time they're away from their computers and in the oilfield. Mobile usage is double the amount for vendor users compared to buyer users (32% vs 16%).</p></div>-->

		<h2>Price Analysis & Comparison</h2>
		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>We made it easy to bid out work but it was still difficult to compare pricing.</p>
		<p class="quote">“I loved the bidding process, but 99% of my time is still consumed on the week long effort of comparing each bid to one another.”</p>
		<p>Every vendor has a different way of pricing and naming their products/services. Traditionally, normalizing pricing meant manipulating cost variables in Excel, which could take weeks.</p>	
				<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>I designed a solution that kept everything in-app and eliminated the time-consuming demands of Excel, ensuring standardized pricing through input validation.</p>

	<p>First, the users needs to specify what line items vendors must fill out. We leave the cost up to the vendors to fill out.</p>

		<h2>Pattern Library</h2>
	


		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>I joined RigUp early on as their only designer, where shipping fast to validate ideas were priority. Creating a design language wasn’t critical at this stage, but a year later I was leading a design team, and our product had quickly reached a level of complexity where our design debt was affecting our efficiency.</p>

		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>We were wasting time creating existing interface components - leading to an inconsistent user experience and bloating our code base with redundancy.</p>

		<h3>Goal</h3>
		<p class="strong">Establish empathy</p>
		<p>Having a unified understanding for rationale and intent makes it easier for cross-functional collaboration.</p>

		<p class="strong">Designing with intent</p>
		<p>When breaking away from an established pattern, we are prompted to question, "Why?" to ensure we're designing with intent.</p>

		<p class="strong">Save time and money</p>
		<p>Having consistent, reusable, and maintanable components allows us to design and develop quicker, as well as spend less time recreating patterns we do not need to reinvent.</p>
</div>
			<div class="full-width">
		<img src="img/bidding/pl.png">
	</div>				<div id="container">
<p>The pattern library is an ongoing process. We have just begun the gradual implementation of its core components. It has already proved valuable as a common ground for designers and developers to reference the rationale behind design decisions, as well as understand context and use cases of patterns.</p>

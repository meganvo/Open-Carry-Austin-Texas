			<h1>RigUp</h1>
			<h2>Making it easy to bid out complex oilfield jobs</h2>
			<p>For two years I lead design at RigUp, an oilfield services marketplace where we made bidding out work easier and more transparent, while maintaining safety and environmental standards.</p>

			<h2>Bidding Process</h2>
			<h3>Problem</h3><p>The bidding process is when buyers in the oilfield bid out work to vendors and select who wins to perform the job. Historically, the process is inefficient and scattered across faxes, phone calls, and a Rolodex.</p>
			<img src="img/bidding/process.png">			
			<section>
			<p>Here's the initial design for creating and sending a bid request, a 6 step wizard UX.</p>
			</div>	
			<div class="full-width"><img src="img/bidding/old_process.png"></div>

		<div id="container">
			<p>There were a couple of problems we discovered through usability testing sessions, feedback from the customer success and sales team, and data analytics.</p>
			<ul>
			<li class="strong">Low conversion rates</li>
			<p>Chunking the bidding process into six separate steps decreased conversion rates. Using <a href="https://heapanalytics.com/" target="_blank">Heap</a>, I was able to pinpoint the drop-off point where we were losing users in the request creation process.</p>
			<li class="strong">Lack of context</li>
			<p>Isolating the steps did not give users enough context to understand the process, causing them to go back and forth between steps to modify their request.</p>
			</ul>

<section>
	<p>I designed a new UX that reduced the process to 3 steps.</p>
	<h3>Solution</h3>
	<p>To begin the request, I designed a modal that prompted the user with the absolute basics: what they are requesting and the type of request, instead of overwhelimng the user off the bat with choices.</p>

	<div id="container">
	<p>Defining the request is where the majority of users dropped off in the bidding process. In the initial design, this was broken into three separate steps. I knew we needed to simplify the process - but how?</p>
	</div>

	<div class="full-width"><img src="img/bidding/step_one_b.png"></div>
	<p class="caption">Define the Request</p>

<section>
	<div id="container">
	<p>Before RigUp, bids are submitted as a PDF or Excel spreadsheet. I compared bids across venders and identified a pattern in how they were compiled. This insight informed my design for a UI that touched on a familiar frame of reference for users. The workscope and request details were the header of the submission, with line items and pricing information below that - structurally similar to an invoice.</p>

	<h3>Specify vendors</h3>
	<p>Once the request is defined, buyers can select who they want to request a quote from. Finding vendors to bid out to is difficult since a lot of them are mom and pop shops without a website. As a result, many companies stick to using vendors that they already know - even if they aren't the safest or best for the job. I designed a marketplace that makes it easy for buyers to find vendors by their services, location, and safety ratings.<p>

		<h3>Managing the request</h3>
		<p>After the request is sent, the user waits for the pricing submissions to roll in. Historically, the bidding process is scattered across phone calls, emails, and faxes. With RigUp, centralizing pricing and communication in one place ensures that confidential documents would not be lost in the shuffle.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="full-width"><img src="img/bidding/rfq_details.png"></div>
	<div id="container">
	<h3>Submitting bids</h3>
	<p>We also made submitting bids easier and secure for vendors. Designing a mobile-first experience for vendors was crucial since most of the time they're away from their computers and in the oilfield. Mobile usage is double the amount for vendor users compared to buyer users (32% vs 16%).</p></div>

		<h2>Price Analysis & Comparison</h2>
		<h3>Problem</h3>
		<p>We made it easy to bid out work but it was still difficult to compare pricing.</p>
		<p class="quote">‚ÄúI loved the bidding process, but 99% of my time is still consumed on the week long effort of comparing each bid to one another.‚Äù - Petroleum Engineer User</p>
		<p>Every vendor has a different way of pricing and naming their products/services. Traditionally, normalizing pricing meant manipulating cost variables in Excel, which could take weeks.</p>	
				<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>I designed a solution that kept everything in-app and eliminated the time-consuming demands of Excel, ensuring standardized pricing through input validation.</p>

	<p>First, the users needs to specify what line items vendors must fill out. We leave the cost up to the vendors to fill out.</p>

		<h2>Pattern Library</h2>
	


		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>I joined RigUp early on as their only designer, where shipping fast to validate ideas were priority. Creating a design language wasn‚Äôt critical at this stage, but a year later I was leading a design team, and our product had quickly reached a level of complexity where our design debt was affecting our efficiency.</p>
		<p>We were wasting time creating existing interface components - leading to an inconsistent user experience and bloating our code base with redundancy.</p></div>

			<div class="full-width">
		<img src="img/bidding/pl.png">
	</div>				<div id="container">
<p>The pattern library is an ongoing process. We have just begun the gradual implementation of its core components. It has already proved valuable as a common ground for designers and developers to reference the rationale behind design decisions, as well as understand context and use cases of patterns.</p>

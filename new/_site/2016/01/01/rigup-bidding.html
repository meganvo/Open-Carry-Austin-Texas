				<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p>The bid creation process was in need of a redesign. The UX was a result of technical and product debt; we were implementing MVP after MVP into the process without any design consideration. It was time to clean up and scale.</p>

<p>The bid creation process had a 46.15% conversion rate. By identifying the highest dropoffs points, I was able to guide my research in where to investigate.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>
<p>The conversion rate increased to 85.66%. Two months after implementation, bid requests increased as well and we were on the right track to meeting our quarterly GMV goal. Additional unanticipated success included increased user retention and less usability questions asked to our customer support team about the bidding process.</p>

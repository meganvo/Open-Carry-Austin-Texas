				<h3 class="post-wrapper" id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p class="post-wrapper">RigUp is an oilfield services marketplace that connects engineers &amp; vendors for an easier bidding process. As the first designer at a small but rapidly growing company, I had to wear a lot hats. I tackled everything from front-end implementation, conducting usability tests, and driving marketing and branding design.</p>

<h3 class="post-wrapper" id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p class="post-wrapper">The bid creation process had a 46.15% conversion rate. By identifying the highest dropoffs points, I was able to guide my research in where to investigate.</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">By identifying the highest dropoffs points, I was able to guide my research in where to investigate. Through usability testing sessions, talking with users and data analytics, I discovered a couple of insights about the bidding process. Step one was initially overwhelming - users were being confronted with many inputs.</p>

<p class="post-img-caption">Step one</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">Users were going back and forth between steps to reference information.
Through card sorting tests, I was able to better understand how users categorize the information.</p>

<h3 class="post-wrapper post-section-title" id="outcome">Outcome</h3>

<p class="post-wrapper">The conversion rate increased to 85.66%. Two months after implementation, bid requests increased and we were on the right track to meeting our quarterly GMV goal. Additional unanticipated success included increased user retention and a decrease in calls to our customer support team.</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">To begin the request the user is prompted with the basics, instead of overwhelimng the user off the bat with choices.</p>

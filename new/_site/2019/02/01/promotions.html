				<p class="post-wrapper">Targeted promotions allowed restaurants to create promotions based on their business goals. I led the design of Promotions across several product phases - from MVP, scaling it as we expanded the feature set, and launching Smart Promotions.</p>

<h2 class="post-wrapper" id="promotion-creation-flow">Promotion Creation Flow</h2>
<p class="post-wrapper company">April 2018</p>

<h3 class="post-wrapper" id="problem">Problem</h3>
<p class="post-wrapper">We initially launched targeted promotions with just two types - new diner and happy hours.  As we expanded our targeting options, the creation flow couldn’t scale in a small modal. We also wanted to understand why restaurants kept starting and stopping campaigns.</p>

<p class="post-img"><img src="/images/promotions/creation_old_landing.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p class="post-img-caption">The first time user experience didn’t offer any education or onboarding to what Targeted Promotions was.</p>

<p class="post-img"><img src="/images/promotions/creation_old.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p class="post-img-caption">The creation flow was contained within a modal with limited targeting and promotion types.</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">In order to grow the product, we needed to take a step back and think beyond its current MVP state. <strong>We ran a week long design sprint.</strong> To kick it off, we conducted expert interviews across stakeholders in Finance, Support, Sales departments to share their insights.</p>

<p class="post-img"><img src="/images/promotions/sprint_2.jpg" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p class="post-wrapper">Through their knowledge, we determined the new creation experience should <strong>educate restaurants</strong> on how Promotions worked, provide <strong>advanced targeting</strong> and <strong>guide restaurants</strong> on what offers are profitable, yet still attract customers.</p>

<h3 class="post-wrapper" id="outcome">Outcome</h3>

<p class="post-wrapper">We created a four step creation flow that guided restaurants throughout the process.</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">First time users would view a landing page that introduced them to the product and set expectations before jumping into creation mode.</p>

<p class="post-img-caption">Step 1: Intro</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">To select a promotion type, we used illustrations that helped restaurants easily identify which goals were the most valuable to their business.</p>

<p class="post-img"><img src="/images/promotions/02_goals.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p class="post-img-caption">Step 2: Select Goals</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">For some restaurants, it can be difficult to figure out what offer attracts customers while also balancing profitability. Recommendations and data-backed hints provide guidance during setup.</p>

<p class="post-img"><img src="/images/promotions/03_details.png" alt="alt text" /></p>
<p class="post-img-caption">Step 3: Offer details</p>

<p class="post-wrapper">The last step allows restaurants review to view their campaign details before launching it across Grubhub platforms.</p>

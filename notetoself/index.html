		<div class="about">
			<p>Inspired by the song "Note to Self" by post-hardcore band From First to Last, 'Note to Self' explores the relationship between the digital and the personal. It is the culmination of the narrative of everyday life; it is a collection of notes spanning 2011–2016 that follow the cusp of college adolescence to the transition to young adult yuppie. From the mundane to the emotional, this project serves as a way to remember everything in between.</p>

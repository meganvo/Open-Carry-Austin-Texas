			<h1>Note to Self: 2011 - 2016</h1>
			<p>Inspired by the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a4C_SxvITk" target="_blank">Note to Self" by post-hardcore band From First to Last</a>, 'Note to Self' explores the relationship between the digital and the personal. It is the culmination of the narrative of everyday life, an archive of notes spanning 2011 to 2016 that touch on the beginning of my college experience to my entry into this so-called real world. From the mundane to the emotional, this project serves as a way to remember everything in between. Just kidding, really just trying to clear the memory in my phone and I'm not clear on how to use iPhoto.</p>

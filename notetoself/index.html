		<div class="about"><h1>Note to Self</h1>
			<h2>2011–2016</h2>
			<p>Inspired by the song "Note to Self" by post-hardcore band From First to Last, 'Note to Self' explores the relationship between the digital and the personal. It is the culmination of the narrative of everyday life; it is a collection of notes spanning 2011–2016.</p> 

			<p>I'm full of shit.</p>
			<!--lol
			<p>
			Two roads split off from here<br>
			And my life goes running in opposite directions<br>
			Exaggerating the barrier between who I am and who I want to be</p>

			<p>I wanted to be that breath of fresh air<br>
			When everything smelled so insincere<br>
			But this taste still lingers in my mouth<br>
			Deceit has ways of sticking around<br>
			And I'm ready to disappear<br>
			Vacation seems far from here</p>

			<p>Note to self: I miss you terribly<br>
			This is what we call a tragedy<br>
			Come back to me, come back to me, to me</p>

			<p>I can feel my mind wandering again<br>
			Into where I don't know, and will I ever get home?<br>
			Time starts moving faster than I can<br>
			And I'm sick of this scene<br>
			I need a break from routine</p>

			<p>Which part of me is lost?<br>
			I feel so close, and yet I am so far</p>-->

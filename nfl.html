			<h1>NFL Draft Social Trend Explorer</h1>
			<p class="category">Web, Interactive â€¢ <a href="http://www.nfl.com/draft/2016/social">View Live</a></p>
			<h2 class="sub-headline">The NFL wanted a way to engage their fans during the draft season - when activity levels decline. I designed an experience where fans could pit players head to head and compare their social media stats.</h2>

			<h3 class="strong">Mobile-first...not just a buzzword</h3>
				<p>My initial iterations split up the actions of adding topics and viewing the p. However, I quickly learned of mobile wires, I realized a better use of space would be to combine the actions into one view.</p>

				<p>It wasn't a time-efficient user experience to input a topic and have to scroll all the way down to view stats and then scroll up to view the graph.</p>

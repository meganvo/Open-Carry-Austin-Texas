			<h2 class="sub-headline">NFL wanted a way to engage their fans during the draft season when scheduled games weren't in effect.  I designed an experience where fans could pit players head to head and compare their social media stats.</h2>

			<h3 class="strong">Mobile first design matters</h3>
				<p>My initial iterations split up the actions of adding topics and viewing the statistics. However, I quickly learned after my initial mobile wires iterations that there was a lack of instant feedback validation once a user inputted a topic. Data would populate below the fold and it wasn't clear to the user that an action occured.</p>

				<p>It wasn't an intutive or efficient UX to input a topic and have to scroll all the way down to view stats and then scroll up to view the graph.</p>

			<h3 class="strong">"Mobile first design" aren't just industry buzz words</h3>
				<p>My initial iterations split up adding players between viewing the statistics. I thought it would be too cluttered to combine the two UIs.

				<p>However, I quickly learned after my initial mobile wires iterations that there was a lack of instant feedback validation once a user added players to the graph. Data would populate below the mobile viewport and it wasn't clear to the user that an action occured. With quick internal testing, I observed the cumbersome behavior of scrolling all the way down to view stats and then scrolling up to view the graph.</p>

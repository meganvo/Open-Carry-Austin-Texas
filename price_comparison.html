			<p>RigUp makes it easy for petroleum engineers to bid out work to hundreds of vendors, however, we were still working through the most efficient way to make price comparison just as easy. Here’s what a couple of our users had to say:</p>

			<p>“I loved the bidding process, but 99% of my time is still consumed on the weeklong effort of comparing each bid to one another.”</p>

			<p>“This saves me a ton of time in figuring out who to bid to, but zero time in trying to figure out who to use.”</p>

<p>The difficulty of comparing pricing ended up decreasing the retention rate of users bidding out work on RigUp.</p>

<h3 class="strong">Problem</h3>
<p>Comparing pricing for jobs in the oilfield is difficult because every vendor has a different way of pricing services. Some prefer to quote a flat rate and others hourly. On top of that, add the complexity of varying line item names, discounts, taxes, and other cost variables. To get things to line up, petroleum engineers must normalize pricing by manipulating cost variables in Excel, which could take weeks.</p>
</p>Traditionally, Excel templates are used to standardize pricing in the energy industry. However, Excel templates are often treated as a suggestion, not a requirement. Pricing continued to vary across the board - vendors would override locked cells, add their own line items, or completely neglect filling it out.</p>

<h3 class="strong">Solution</h3>
<p>I designed a solution that kept templates an in-app experience and eliminated the time-consuming demands of Excel Excel, which streamlined user experience and ensured standardized pricing through input validation.</p>

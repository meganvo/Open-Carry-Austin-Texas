			<p>One of the first problems I tackled at RigUp was how we could improve the bidding process. This is where buyers reach out to multiple vendors, request a quote for an upcoming job, and select who wins the work.</p>


			<h3 class="strong">Finding vendors</h3>
			<p>Finding vendors to bid out to is difficult. Many vendors are mom and pop shops without a web presence. The Marketplace makes it easy for buyers to find vendors by their products and services, as well as location.</p>
			
			<p>We went through a lot of iterations on how to display vendor information in the Marketplace. Through usability testing, I learned how UI copy affects conversion rates. Users were apprehensive to click the request bid button, thinking it would automatically shoot out a request - so we changed the copy to “Add to Request”.</p>

			<h3 class="strong">Sending out a bid request</h3>
			<p>The process for creating a request rapidly evolved from manual emails → a humble modal → a multi-step wizard flow. It was important that we knew what data we needed to capture and how to chunk the information, before building a robust creation process.</p>

			<h3 class="strong">Viewing price submissions</h3>
			<p>The bidding process is usually scattered across phone calls, emails, and faxes. With RigUp, centralizing all pricing and communication in one places ensures that confidential documents would not be lost in the shuffle.</p>
			<p>Users can view pricing submissions as they came in. During a sales demo of our product, we unintentionally I initially designed pricing submissions using a card UI, but we quickly learned that this layout made it hard to flip through pricing. </p>

			<h3 class="strong">Submitting bids</h3>
			<p>We also made submitting bids easier for vendors. Many vendors are out in the field away from their computers, so designing a mobile-first experience for them was crucial. Mobile usage is double the amount for vendor users compared to buyer users (32% vs 16%).</p>

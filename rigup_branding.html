			<p>As the first designer on the team, I brought design culture to the organization and built its pattern library and brand from the ground up.</p>

<p>I joined RigUp early on as their only designer, where shipping fast to validate ideas were priority. Creating a design language wasnâ€™t critical at this stage, but a year later I was leading a design team, and the site had quickly reached a level of complexity where our design debt was affecting our efficiency.</p>

<p>I determined that we were wasting time creating existing interface components - leading to an inconsistent user experience and bloating our code base with redundancy.</p>

<p>I subsequently put together an interface inventory that enabled us to visualize the overall state of our design language. It was clear that we needed to prioritize our core components first - things like the grid system, colors, typography, buttons, and spacing.</p>

<p>The pattern library is an ongoing process, and we have just begun the gradual implementation of its core components. It has already proved valuable as a common ground for designers and developers  to reference the rationale behind design decisions, as well as understand context and use cases of patterns.</p>

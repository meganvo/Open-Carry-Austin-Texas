title: Creation flow redesign
summary: Increasing campaign creation with a scalable creation flow
description: Targeted promotions allowed restaurants to create promotions based on their business goals. We launched targeted promotions with just two types - new diner and happy hours. As we expanded our targeting options, we needed to scale the creation flow to allow for more promotion types and targeting options.

Targeted promotions allowed restaurants to create promotions based on their business goals. I led design across several product phases - from MVP, scaling it as we expanded the feature set, and launching Smart Promotions.

### Problem
{: .post-wrapper}

We launched targeted promotions with just two types - new diner and happy hours. As we expanded our targeting options, the creation flow couldn't scale in a small modal. We also wanted to understand why restaurants kept starting and stopping campaigns.

#### Almost 20% of campaigns created were stopped within a day.

The creation flow was contained within a modal with limited targeting and promotion types.

We needed to take a step back and think beyond its current MVP state and run a design sprint. To kick it off, we conducted expert interviews across stakeholders in Finance, Support, Sales departments to share their insights.

Through their knowledge, we determined the new creation experience should educate restaurants on how Promotions worked, provide targeting and guide restaurants on what offers are profitable, yet still attract customers.

### Outcome
{: .post-wrapper}

#### **Less than 1% of campaigns were stopped within a day.**

The new creation flow guided restaurants throughout the process.

### Challenge
Our internal team has a dashboard that surfaces restaurant performance across the conversion funnel. This allows them to pinpoint where customers drop off and offer recommendations on how to improve this - like uploading photos to their menu. 

Since restaurants didn’t have access to this, they had to explain all of this over the phone or email which wasn't a scalable solution. We needed to leverage this data and surface it in our restaurant management app.

This was one of the first projects I worked on in my U. Remember using Photoshop Layer Comps?

### Overview
{: .post-wrapper}
The NFL needed a way to engage their audience during the off season. Since draft picks didn't have active player stats yet, we utilized their social media statistics instead. Working closely with a developer to understand the constraints of our charting library, I designed an interactive experience for fans.

Understanding data can be daunting, but it doesn't have to be. To help users make sense of it all, I designed a simple onboarding experience using step-by-step tooltips for first time users.

Is 5,000 total tweets a lot? What about 50,000? It's hard to understand what numbers mean without context. Twitter benchmarks provided context to give user's a better sense of a player's popularity. Depending on the range of values, different benchmarks would appear.

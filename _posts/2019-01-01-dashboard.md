Grubhub has tons of data on what makes a restaurant successful. I worked on the Insights Dashboard to transform this complex data into actionable recommendations that help restaurants improve their performance across the conversion funnel.

### Challenge
{: .post-wrapper}

Our internal team has a dashboard that surfaces restaurant performance across the conversion funnel. This allows them to pinpoint where customers drop off and offer recommendations on how to improve this - like uploading photos to their menu. Since restaurants didnâ€™t have access to this, they had to explain all of this over the phone or email which wasn't a scalable solution. We needed to leverage this data and surface it in our restaurant management app.

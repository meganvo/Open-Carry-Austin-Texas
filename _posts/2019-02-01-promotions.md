Targeted promotions allowed restaurants to create promotions based on their business goals. I led design across several product phases - from MVP, scaling it as we expanded the feature set, and launching Smart Promotions.

### Problem
{: .post-wrapper}

We launched targeted promotions with just two types - new diner and happy hours. As we expanded our targeting options, the creation flow couldn't scale in a small modal. We also wanted to understand why restaurants kept starting and stopping campaigns.

#### **Almost 20% of campaigns created were stopped within a day.**

#### **Creation modal couldn't scale to allow more targeting options.**

The first time user experience didn't offer any education or onboarding to what Targeted Promotions was.

The creation flow was contained within a modal with limited targeting and promotion types.

### Running a design sprint

We needed to take a step back and think beyond its current MVP state and run a design sprint. To kick it off, we conducted expert interviews across stakeholders in Finance, Support, Sales departments to share their insights.

Through their knowledge, we determined the new creation experience should **educate restaurants** on how Promotions worked, provide **advanced targeting** and **guide restaurants** on what offers are profitable, yet still attract customers.

### Outcome
{: .post-wrapper}

#### **Less than 1% of campaigns were stopped within a day.**

The new creation flow guided restaurants throughout the process.

First time users would view a landing page that introduced them to the product and set expectations before jumping into creation mode.

Step 1: Intro

To select a promotion type, we used illustrations that helped restaurants easily identify which goals were the most valuable to their business.

Step 2: Select Goals

For some restaurants, it can be difficult to figure out what offer attracts customers while also balancing profitability. Recommendations and data-backed hints provide guidance during setup.
